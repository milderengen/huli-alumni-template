- My first project after this course
- Bot takes matches from sport bets API then calculates if matches fit Arbitrage betting criterias 
- Returns matches and concrete Bets that can be done
- Also returns Last updated time, teams name, betting site and all these things.


- API code in this version is DUMMY one because i dont really want someone to abuse this and cost me 1000â‚¬ debt lol.
